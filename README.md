# Undergraduate Research
This repository hold the assignments that I was given under the supervision of Professor Kaeli. These assignments are to teach and refine my skills in programming while also learning about parallel programming, using different algorithms such as Quicksort and learn Machine Learning algorithms such as regression and CUDA framework.
